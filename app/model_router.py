"""Model router — one place that knows which model does what (master spec §6/§7).

Every Gemini call site used to hard-code a model string ("gemini-flash-latest",
"gemini-flash-lite-latest", …). That meant no way to promote a new model, no
fallback when a model rate-limits, and no difference between a planner that
needs to think and a summariser that needs to be quick.

Roles (master spec §6): DEFAULT, FAST, REASONING, CODING, VISION, EMBEDDING,
FALLBACK — plus IMAGE for image generation. Each role resolves to a concrete
model id; Settings → AI → MODEL ROLES can override any of them (config key
``model_roles``). An override that names a model the SDK can't see is treated
like any other failure: it is benched and the fallback role takes over.

Failure handling (§6/§58) — never retry the same thing blind:

    classify_error(exc) → rate_limit | auth | timeout | context_overflow |
                          quota | provider | unknown
    note_result(model, ok, err) → benched for a cooldown on failure,
                                   cleared on success
    generate(client, …) → attempt 1: role model
                          attempt 2+: another healthy model (fallback family)
                          auth errors raise immediately — another model
                          cannot fix a bad key.

The router never talks to the network itself; it only picks ids. Call sites
keep their own client construction (`genai.Client(...)` or the live session),
so a router bug can never take the voice session down.

"""JARVIS Learning Engine (spec §9-§16, §40, §56).

Controlled continuous learning - no self-modifying binaries:

* Corrections: user corrects JARVIS -> recorded, contradictions superseded.
* Success/failure: tool and provider outcomes accumulate into stats.
* Workflows: repeated successful sequences become reusable workflows.
* Experiences: reusable knowledge gets stored and linked.
* Adaptive tool selection: prefer the most reliable tool for an intent once
  enough evidence exists (never after a single event - spec §13).

All state lives in the brain memory database, so learning survives restarts.

"""JARVIS skill registry — one declarative map of everything JARVIS can do.

Why this exists
---------------
The abilities already live in the project (actions/, vision/, memory/, browser
and computer control, dev_agent, ...). What was missing was a single place that
says, for each capability: *what it is for, when it should be picked, which
tools implement it, what configuration it needs, and what it usually hands off
to*. That is all this module is.

Design rules
------------
* Metadata + routing + prompt text only — no work happens here, and no existing
  tool/action module is reimplemented or replaced.
* Zero heavy imports: safe to import from the Qt UI thread, the asyncio live
  loop, or a background worker.
* One skill = one small declaration. Adding a capability later means appending a
  ``Skill`` entry, not touching the other skills.
* Everything degrades: an unknown skill key, a missing config file or a failed
  route never raises to the caller.

Routing is deliberately deterministic (word-boundary matching over declared
triggers, weighted by priority) so the same request always selects the same
skills, and so it costs microseconds with no model round trip.
